# Lāhainā Fire Analysis
An investigation of how landcover change, particularly in the extent of agricultural lands, has been associated with increases in burned area from wildfires in Hawaiʻi. This analysis quantifies the extent to which non-native vegetation that dominates unmanaged colonial pasture and croplands have contributed increases in burned area over the past 24 years. 

Datasets include:
1. Area used for pasture, sugarcane, pineapple, total croplands in Hawaiʻi since 1898
2. Annual burned area in Hawaiʻi from 1904-2022
3. Burned area from large (mosly >20 ha) wildfires that occurred from 1999-2022 associated with former pasture, sugarcane, or pineapple land across all of Hawaiʻi
4. Burned area from large (mosly >20 ha) wildfires that occurred from 1999-2022 associated with former pasture, sugarcane, or pineapple land in West Maui (including Lāhainā and Kāʻanapali)
5. Monthly rainfall in West Maui from January 1999 through July 2023.
